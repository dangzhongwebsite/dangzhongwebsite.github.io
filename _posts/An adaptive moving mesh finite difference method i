An adaptive moving mesh finite difference method is presented to solve two types of equations with dynamic capillary pressure term in porous media. One is the non-equilibrium Richa     rds Equation and the other is the modified Buckley-Leverett equation. The governing equations are discretized with an adaptive moving mesh finite difference method in the space dir     ection and an implicit-explicit method in the time direction. An adaptive time-dependent monitor function with directional control is applied to redistribute the mesh grid in every      time step. In order to obtain high quality meshes, a smoothing technique based on a diffusive mechanism is used. The behaviors of the central difference flux, the standard local L     ax-Friedrich flux and the local Lax-Friedrich flux with reconstruction are investigated by solving a 1D modified Buckley-Leverett equation. With the moving mesh technique, good mes     h quality and high numerical accuracy are obtained. A collection of one-dimensional and two-dimensional numerical experiments is presented to demonstrate the accuracy and effective     ness of the proposed method
